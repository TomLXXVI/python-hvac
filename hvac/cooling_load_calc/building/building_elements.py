    An exterior building element is on one side exposed to the outdoor

    the given climatic design information valid for the specified design day on

    The material construction of an exterior building element is defined by its

    The conductive heat transfer through an exterior building element depends on
    its thermal mass (thermal inertia). To determine this time-dependent heat 
    transfer, the exterior building element is modeled by a linear thermal 
    network consisting of temperature nodes, which have a thermal capacitor

            Name for the temperature node on the interior surface side of the 
            building element, where the interior surface temperature is present. 
            Can be either an internal temperature node (part of the linear 
            thermal network) or an external temperature node (i.e. an input of 
            the linear thermal network system). If `None`, the default name 
            `T_is` is given.
        closed:
            Indicates if the linear thermal network model should be closed or
            not. 
            If `closed` is true, the linear thermal network is terminated on its
            interior side by an "interior surface temperature node". In that 
            case the linear thermal network system is a single-input/
            single-output system (SISO) with the input being the sol-air 
            temperature on the exterior side of the building element, and the 
            output of the system is the temperature of the interior surface.
            The interior surface node has no resistor that connects it with an
            external environment (the indoor environment).
            Note that in this case it is assumed that no external heat flow can 
            leave or enter the interior surface node (it is isolated from the 
            external environment); only internal heat transfer between the 
            interior surface node and its preceding node in the linear thermal 
            network is possible.
            If `closed` is false (default), the thermal resistor of the last 
            (building mass) temperature node in the network is connected to an 
            external temperature node on the interior side of the building 
            element. In that case the linear thermal network system has now two 
            inputs (the sol-air temperature on the exterior side and the indoor 
            air temperature on the interior side), and the temperature of the 
            last (building mass) node is now the output of the system.
        
        Notes
        -----
        To determine the conduction heat gain at the interior side of the
        exterior building element for a given indoor air temperature, the
        linear thermal network should be open-ended (`closed=False`).
        
        To connect the linear thermal network model of the exterior building
        element with a zone model, the linear thermal network should be
        closed (`closed=True`). 
        The connection with a zone model is actually done with two separate 
        connections. 
        One connection connects the "interior surface node" of the exterior 
        building element with the "zone-air mass node" of the zone model. This 
        connection has a "convective heat-transfer" resistor (`R_conv`), that 
        represents convective heat transfer between the interior surface and the
        zone air. 
        The other connection connects the "interior surface node" of the 
        exterior building element with the "interior mass node" of the zone 
        model, which models thermal storage of radiative heat inside the 
        interior mass of a zone. This connection has a "radiative heat-transfer"
        resistor (`R_rad`), that represents radiative heat transfer between the 
        interior surface and the interior mass of the zone. 
        The convective resistor (`R_conv`) is the thermal resistance of the 
        interior surface film. The value of the radiative resistor is determined
        by the specified parameter `F_rad`. If the given construction assembly
        has been configured with an interior surface film layer, the attributes 
        `R_conv` and `R_rad` of the `ExteriorBuildingElementModel` object are 
        instances of class `Resistor`. Otherwise, these attributes will remain 
        `None`.
