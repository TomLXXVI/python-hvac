class TemperatureNode:
    """Represents a temperature node in a linear thermal network.

    A temperature node has a unit thermal capacity `C`, expressed per unit of
    area, i.e., in SI units J/(K.mÂ²).
    The node can be connected on two sides (the left and the right side) to
    either another temperature node in the linear network, or to the adjacent
    environment through a thermal resistor. The thermal resistor on the left is
    designated `R1`, while the resistor on the right is designated `R2`. The
    thermal resistance is expressed on the basis of one unit area, i.e., in SI
    units K.mÂ²/W.
    The surface area, `A`, associated with a temperature node is considered
    separately.

    If the temperature node is connected on one or on both sides to an
    environment, the known environmental temperature as a function of time can
    be connected to the other end of the thermal resistor present on that side
    of the temperature node: on the left side through parameter `T_fun1`, and
    on the right side through parameter `T_fun2`. To return the known
    temperature at a given time moment `t`, these functions need to be called
    by passing this time moment `t` to them. Time moment `t` is the time
    measured from a certain zero point in time, and must be expressed in seconds.

    Instead of a thermal resistor in combination with a temperature function, it
    is also possible to connect a function to the node that directly returns the
    heat flow into or out of the node at a given time moment `t`; the parameter
    `Q_dot_fun1` on the left side of the node is considered to be heat input,
    while the parameter `Q_dot_fun2` is considered to be heat output (so heat
    flows from left to right through the linear thermal network).
