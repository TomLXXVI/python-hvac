    An exterior building element is on one side exposed to the outdoor

    the given climatic design information valid for the specified design day on

    The material construction of an exterior building element is defined by its
    construction assembly, an object of class `ConstructionAssembly`.
    
    The conductive heat transfer through an exterior building element depends on
    its thermal mass (thermal inertia). To determine this time-dependent heat 
    transfer, the exterior building element is modeled by a linear thermal 
    network consisting of temperature nodes, which have a thermal capacitor 
    (a "heat reservoir") and are interconnected by thermal resistors (see module

        at each time step of the last calculation cycle.

        Returns None if the exterior building element has no linear thermal

        Notes
        -----
        To determine the heat transfer through the exterior building element,
        the linear thermal network model of the exterior building element is
        solved.
        At the exterior side of the building element, the known input function
        is the sol-air temperature, being a function of time.
        At the interior side of the building element, the known input function
        is the controlled zone air temperature. If a single `Quantity` was 
        passed to `T_zone` when instantiating the `ExteriorBuildingElement` 
        object, it is assumed that the temperature control of the zone keeps 
        the zone air temperature constant in time.
        
        The calculations using the linear thermal network model, being a linear
        system of first order differential equations, start at time t = 0 s, 
        which is at midnight of the design day. The second time moment is at 
        `dt_hr` * 3600 s, the third time moment is at 2 * `dt_hr` * 3600 s, 
        and so on. The total number of steps is determined as 24 hr / `dt_hr`,
        rounded to the nearest integer. So, the duration of the design day is
        divided in (24 hr / `dt_hr`) equal time intervals. When the last
        calculation step at t = (n - 1) * `dt_hr` * 3600 s is finished,
        one diurnal calculation cycle is finished.
        
        To solve the linear thermal network for the node temperatures, it is
        necessary to know the initial values of all the node temperatures at 
        t = 0 s. The initial values of the node temperatures are internally set
        all equal to the sol-air temperature at the exterior surface of the
        building element at t = 0 s. As the values of the node temperatures at
        t > 0 s will depend on these first initial values, the diurnal cycle 
        needs to be repeated multiple times to reduce the influence of these
        arbitrarily chosen initial values. The number of repetitions can be set 
        with parameter `num_cycles`. 
        The results from the final time step in the previous cycle are then used
        as initial values for the next cycle. It is as if the same daily weather
        cycle of the design day repeats itself for several days in a row.

        Creates an `InteriorBuildingElement` object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ID:
            Identifies the interior building element.
        T_zone:
            The zone air temperature, being a function with signature
            `f(t_sol_sec: float) -> Quantity` which takes the solar time in
            seconds and returns the temperature in the zone as a `Quantity`
            object. This may allow a time-variable temperature in the zone.
        T_adj:
            The temperature in the adjacent space, being a function with
            signature `f(t_sol_sec: float) -> Quantity` which takes the solar
            time in seconds and returns the temperature in the adjacent space
            as a `Quantity` object. This allows a time-variable temperature in
            the adjacent space that may be an unconditioned space.
        constr_assem:
            The construction assembly the interior building element is made of.
        gross_area:
            The gross surface area of the interior building element, i.e.
            including any large openings such as doors and windows.
        F_rad: default 0.46
            Radiative fraction of the conduction heat gain through the interior
            building element, taken up by the interior thermal mass of the
            space. (see ASHRAE Fundamentals 2017, chapter 18, table 14).

            Time step expressed as a fraction of 1 hour, e.g., `dt_hr` = 1/4
            means the time step for the calculations is one quarter of an hour.
