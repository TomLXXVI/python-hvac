class VAVSingleZoneAirCoolingSystem:
    """
    Model for analyzing the steady-state part-load operation of a single-zone
    VAV air-cooling system equipped with an air-cooling coil and optionally an
    air-heating coil.

    The aim is to maintain the zone air setpoint temperature under the given
    set of external conditions (outdoor air state, sensible and latent zone
    load). To accomplish this, the mass flow rate of supply air is modulated,
    while the cooled air leaving the cooling coil remains at a fixed state
    (it is assumed that both temperature and humidity remain fixed).
    However, the supply air mass flow rate cannot drop below a certain minimum
    limit (to ensure proper mixing of supply air with zone air), and it also
    cannot become greater than the maximum capacity of the supply fan.
    If the minimum limit of the supply air mass flow is reached, the cooled air
    needs to be heated if a heating coil is present or the setpoint temperature
    of the cooled air needs to be increased. Otherwise, the zone air temperature
    will decrease below its setpoint.
    If the maximum limit of the supply air mass flow rate is reached, the zone
    air temperature will increase beyond its setpoint, unless the setpoint
    temperature of the cooled air can be decreased. Otherwise, the zone air
    temperature will increase above its setpoint.

    Mixing control (economizer operation) may allow reaching the cooling air
    temperature setpoint without mechanical cooling if outdoor air temperature
    is lower than this cooling air temperature setpoint.
    If outdoor air temperature is between the cooling air temperature setpoint
    and the zone air setpoint temperature, the temperature of the mixed air will
    be higher than the outdoor air temperature, and it will cost more cooling
    energy to cool this air to the cooling air temperature setpoint. Therefore,
    recirculation of return air is set to a minimum (zero), and all supply air
    to the zone will come from outdoors.
    If outdoor air temperature is above the zone air temperature setpoint, the
    outdoor air flow rate is restricted to what's required for zone ventilation
    only and recirculation of return air is now at its maximum.
