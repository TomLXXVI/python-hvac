    "Interior building elements are modeled by the `InteriorBuildingElement` class. Like exterior building elements, their size and construction are also characterized by their gross area and the construction assembly they're made of. They also have a parameter `F_rad` to split the conduction heat gain through the interior building element into a convective and a radiative fraction. Where `ExteriorBuildingElement` objects carry data about the outdoor environment (the `WeatherData` object), an `InteriorBuildingElement` object needs to carry data about the adjacent thermal zone it separates from the thermal zone under consideration. These data are the zone-air temperature in the adjacent zone (which is considered to be a fixed value), and, in case ventilation air is transferred from the adjacent zone to the considered zone, the (design value of the) transfer air volume flow rate.

    "Like an `ExteriorBuildingElement` object, a `ThermalZone` object is represented by a linear thermal network model. This model has two temperature nodes: a zone-air node, which represents the air volume in the thermal zone, and an interior mass node, which incorporates the internal structural mass (floor, ceiling, partitions) and also furnishings of the thermal zone, to take their thermal storage effect on the cooling/heating load of the thermal zone into account. The concept of this model is explained in more detail in *Mitchell, J. W., & Braun, J. E. (2012). Principles of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning in Buildings. John Wiley & Sons*.\n",

It is the sum of the convective heat transfer resistance and that of any floor surfaces such as carpeting. The unit convective resistance for the interior of buildings is around 0.12 K.m²/W. The unit thermal resistance of carpeting ranges from about 0.1 to 0.4 K.m²/W.\n",

The unit thermal capacity of the interior mass may range from 100 kJ/(m².K) for light building construction to 300 kJ/(m².K) for heavy building construction. The surface area also depends on the type of internal structure, and is at least equal to the floor area. A reasonable estimate would be two to three times the actual floor area.  "
