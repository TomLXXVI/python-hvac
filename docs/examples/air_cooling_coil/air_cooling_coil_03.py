Given:
- An air-cooling coil in a space is cooling the space air.
- The mass flow rate of water through the air-cooling coil is known.
- The entering water temperature is known.
- The mass flow rate of air through the air-cooling coil is known.
- The sensible and latent space cooling load.

Calculate the space air state when steady-state operation (thermal equilibrium)
has been established (the thermal power absorbed by the water in the air-cooling
coil balances the total cooling load of the space).

Do this calculation for a range of space-cooling loads having different sensible
heat ratios. It's assumed that the space cooling load remains constant as the
space air temperature and humidity ratio evolve towards their steady-state
values.
