    "The network configuration table has been prepared for analyzing the duct network using the Hardy Cross method. The fact that we are analyzing an existing duct system implies that we know the length and diameter of each duct in the network. The volume flow rates through the ducts are in fact initially guessed values, which could be e.g., design values demanded by a certain ventilation standard. When volume flow rates are assigned to ducts, care must be taken to respect the physical law of conservation of mass in the nodes of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the scheme, it can be seen that the network contains 6 loops. With each loop a positive loop sense is associated, which is conventionally chosen to be the clock-wise sense. In the duct network, all air is exhausted through node N1 and air enters the duct system through exhaust valves at nodes N4 to N10. With this information, the sense of the airflow direction in each duct can be determined. In the Hardy Cross method, the sense of direction of the air flow in a duct is coupled to the sense of the loop's direction to which the duct belongs. E.g., in duct D10 the sense of the airflow direction matches with the sense of its loop L1. As such, we've entered the volume flow rate through duct D10 with a positive sign in the network configuration file. On the other hand, the sense of airflow direction in duct D7 is opposite to the sense of its loop L6, and therefore we've entered the volume flow rate through duct D7 with a minus sign in the network configuration file. \n",
    "\n",
    "A duct can belong to 2 loops. E.g., duct D4 belongs to loop L3 and to loop L4. In the network configuration file we've entered the loops L3 and L4 between parentheses and separated by a comma (note: the parentheses should not be forgotten!). The sign of the volume flow rate is referred to the sense of the first entered loop. In this example, this is loop L3. As the sense of airflow direction in duct D4 is opposite to the sense of loop L3, we've entered the volume flow rate through duct D4 with a minus sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column names cannot be chosen freely, but the order of the columns is less important, as the csv-file is read using the `csv.DictReader` class. Note that each duct must have a start node and an end node. The program needs this information to find out how ducts are interconnected in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all loops in this example are actually open loops. E.g. in loop L1, there is, in reality, no duct present between nodes N4 and N5. However, in the network configuration file we've entered a duct D11 between nodes N4 and N5. Such a fictitious duct, used to close a loop, is also called a \"pseudo duct\". It has no length, no diameter, and there is no air flow through it. In the network configuration file, we leave these cells empty, which is the reason why NaN (\"Not a Number\") was filled in by Pandas, when it read the csv-file from disk into `network_config_table` (a `DataFrame` object). On the other hand, there can be a fixed pressure difference between the start and end node of a pseudo duct. In this example, nodes N4 to N10 are all at the same pressure (atmospheric pressure), so we've entered 0 in column *fixed_pressure_difference* for each of the pseudo ducts present in the network. For real ducts, column *fixed_pressure_difference* has no meaning, and we should leave the cells under this column empty. Should there be a fixed pressure difference between the start and end node of a pseudo duct that isn't zero, we must take care to also add the appropriate sign to this fixed pressure difference. E.g. suppose that node N4 is at higher pressure than node N5. In that case, air would flow from node N4 to node N5, and the sense of direction of this fictitious air flow would be opposite to the sense of loop L1, which is why a minus sign should be added to the value of the fixed pressure difference between node N4 and node N5.

    "Once all fittings have been added to the ducts, the configuration of the duct network is finished. We can take a look again at the duct table to see that by adding the fittings to the ducts, the pressure losses across the ducts have been changed. It is also possible to get a table with an overview of all the fittings present in the network, together with their pressure loss coefficient (zeta) and associated pressure drop. Finally, we can also get a table showing the different flow paths in the duct system."

    "- 'Δp-dyn.' refers to the pressure loss between the start and end node of a path due to fluid flow and fitting losses, i.e., the dynamic pressure difference between the start and end node of the path.\n",

    "- 'Δp-deficit.' is the difference between the total pressure difference of the critical flow path and the total pressure difference of the path under consideration. The critical flow path is the flow path with the greatest total pressure difference and for which the pressure difference deficit is evidently zero. \n",

So, the same pressure difference must exist across each flow path. It is obvious here that with the initial volume flow rates that we've entered into the network configuration table, the law of conservation of energy is not being obeyed. Consequently, the purpose of analyzing this air exhaust system is to find the real volume flow rates that will pass through each duct of the network."

In fact, the law of conservation of energy requires the pressure difference across each loop to be zero (any point along any loop in the network can have only one pressure or energy value).
