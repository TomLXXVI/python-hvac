    "This table is used to design a pipe network. When designing a pipe network, the length and the design volume flow rate of each pipe are already known. A reasonable specific pressure drop needs to be chosen for each pipe. In this case, a specific pressure drop of 0.2 kPa/m has been selected. Notice that there are no measuring units mentioned in the table. We can use any appropriate unit we want for a certain quantity, but later on we will have to tell the program which units we are using. In the last column *schedule* a name has been entered that refers to a collection of commercially available pipe sizes. More explanation about this feature will follow, but first a worth about the header labels:\n",
    "- The column *conduit_ID* contains a reference name or ID for each pipe in the network.\n",
    "- The column *start_node_ID* specifies the ID of the pipe's start node, i.e. the node where the fluid leaves.\n",
    "- The column *end_node_ID* specifies the ID of the pipe's end node, i.e. the node where the fluid arrives.\n",
    "- The column *loop_ID* is not required, and thus optional, when designing a pipe network, but we will need this if we want to analyze our network later on with the Hardy Cross method. This will be explained in a subsequent notebook where we will analyze the network when control valves are closed more.\n",
    "- The column *schedule* contains a reference name (that you can choose freely) to a collection of commercially available pipe sizes. When designing a network, this column is optional. You can also assign only one schedule to the whole network if all pipes in the network are of the same family. Or you could omit the schedule, but then theoretical pipe diameters will be returned, which probably won't be commercially available.\n",
    "- The column *length* contains the length of each pipe (expressed in units you prefer)\n",
    "- The column *volume_flow_rate* contains the design volume flow rate in each pipe (expressed in units you prefer)\n",
    "- The column *specific_pressure_drop* contains the pressure drop per unit pipe length (expressed in units you prefer)\n",

If the latter case is true, you can easily change this in the spreadsheet program, e.g. by selecting the table or the whole sheet and then changing the language formatting to a format that uses a point to separate the decimals of a number before saving as a csv-file."

    "For a number of pipe fittings and valves, the resistance coefficient can be calculated with the formulas of the well-known technical guide TP-410M by Crane. These fittings and valves are located in module `crane.py` of the above-mentioned package. In the following, we will add tees at the nodes of the cross-overs in the network. On the supply side of the network (with the 'S*x*' labeled nodes in the scheme above) the fluid flow at the nodes is diverging, while on the return side of the network (with the 'R*x*' labeled nodes) the fluid flow is converging. The 'combined pipe' of a tee is where the fluid flows from the branch and straight leg combine (i.e. the sum of flow through the branch and through the straight leg). To create a tee at node S1, the following code will do:"

On the return side, the reverse is true. Therefore, we will add reducers on the supply side and enlargers on the return side. Reducers will be positioned at the start of the smallest pipe (notice `zeta_small`, i.e., the resistance coefficient of the reducer referenced to the pipe with the smaller diameter), while enlargers will be positioned at the start of the largest pipe (notice `zeta_large`).

    "Calling method `get_flow_path_table` returns a Pandas `DataFrame` object with all the flow paths between the start and end node of the network. The first column *Δp-elev* refers to the gravity, stack or chimney effect, which is due to the elevation difference between the start and end node of the network and due to the density difference between the fluid and the ambient air. In a hydronic, closed system this term will always be zero. The second column *Δp-dyn* refers to the pressure loss due to pipe friction and dynamic effects in fittings and valves. The third column *Δp-tot* is the sum of the first two columns. The last column *Δp-deficit* refers to the difference in total pressure between the critical flow path (i.e. the path having the greatest pressure loss) and the other flow paths between the start and end node of the network. For the critical path, this value will obviously be zero. In a perfectly balanced pipe network, all flow paths will have a pressure difference deficit nearing to zero."

    "The control valves in the cross-overs serve to control the volume flow rate through the heat emitters in the hydronic distribution system during part-load conditions. They are installed upstream of the heat emitter they control. First, a preliminary flow coefficient is calculated based on a target value for the valve authority. This target value should be at least 0.5 to attain a good controllability of the control valve."

    "Between the start and end node of the balanced pipe network, the pressure difference will be equal to the pressure loss along the critical path. As the network is balanced, each flow path between the start and end node of the network produces the same pressure loss, as can be seen in the flow path table above. The ratio of the pressure difference to the square of the volume flow rate that enters the network through the start node (and leaves through the end node) is a measure of the network's hydraulic resistance. If the volume flow rate into the network changes, the hydraulic resistance of the network will remain the same, and as such, the pressure difference between the start node and end node of the network will change accordingly to the square of the volume flow rate. The relationship between volume flow rate through and pressure difference across the hydraulic resistance of a pipe network is graphically shown by the system curve. However, if the opening of any control valve in the network changes, the hydraulic resistance of the network will also change. Consequently, the system curve will also change. Moreover, the network won't be (perfectly) balanced anymore, meaning that volume flow rates through other cross-overs will also inevitably change. This will be demonstrated in another example."
